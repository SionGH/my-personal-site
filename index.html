                <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I have made my home base in sunny Gran Canary Island. My tech journey
                       started with a Master's in Graphic Design, followed by a diploma in
                       UX Design. It was then that I fell for coding. I was hooked and wanted 
                       to learn more about how to take my design further and build my site. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut.
                        When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found
                        something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for
                        in my work. Now I have made a full switch to front-end development,
                        where I can use my design skills and eye for detail to write
                        clean, elegant code.

                    <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by
                        hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to
                        collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

                    <h3>Well-Organized css</h3>
                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build
                        on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I
                        make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

                    <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                    <p>You can trust me to take a designers PSD and quickly &
                        accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect
                        match.
